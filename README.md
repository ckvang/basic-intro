#Introduction
##Hello world! :grin:
My name is **Crystal Vang**. I was born in Chico, CA but am currently residing in Oroville, CA, a small city about 25 miles south of here. Presently, I am in the last year of my undergraduate education in *computer engineering* with a minor in *computer science*. Outside of the classroom, I am President of Tau Beta Pi, the Engineering Honor Society, and a member of the Society of Women Engineers. My hobbies consist of outdoor volleyball, photography, and collecting random items from places that I have been to.
